  <description><![CDATA[Improved version of Delete button, that allows to delete item even if it has dependencies.

Prior to item is deleted dependent items also deleted or modified.

Cases when dependent items are modified:
- component presentation is removed from page;
- TBB is removed from PT or CT;
- TBB is removed from compound TBB;
- linked schema is removed from CT;
- metadata schema is removed from any object that supports metadata;
- parameter schema is removed from any template object;
- schema keyword field is changed to text field (to unlink category and schema);
- component link is removed from component/metadata (component link field is changed to non-mandatory, if necessary);
- element history is deleted, if old dependencies found.

If dependency if not from the list above then dependent item is deleted prior to delete selected item.

It is possible to review all changes to be done before irreversible changes are made.]]></description>
