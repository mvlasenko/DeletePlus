  <description><![CDATA[Improved version of Delete button, that allows to delete item even if it has dependencies.

Prior to item is deleted dependent items also deleted or modified (dependent on checkbox)

Cases when dependent items can be modified:
- component presentation is removed from page;
- TBB is removed from PT or CT;
- TBB is removed from compound TBB;
- linked schema is removed from CT;
- metadata schema is removed from any object that supports metadata;
- parameter schema is removed from any template object;
- schema keyword field is changed to text field (to unlink category and schema);
- component link is removed from component/metadata (component link field is changed to non-mandatory, if necessary);
- component link schema is removed from allowed schemas link (unlink two schemas);
- embedded schema field is removed (unlink two schemas);
- element history is deleted, if old dependencies found.

If dependency is not from the list above then dependent item is deleted prior to delete selected item.

It is possible to review all changes before irreversible changes are made.]]></description>
